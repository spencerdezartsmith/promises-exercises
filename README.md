### Day 4 & 5
- [x] Exercises 1-13 in the [promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions][promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions] are complete and written to the appropriate file:
  - [x] `src/01-warmup.js`
  - [x] `src/02-fullfill-a-promise.js`
  - [x] `src/03-reject-a-promise.js`

  - [x] `src/07-promise-after-promise.js`
  - [x] `src/08-values-and-promises.js`
  - [x] `src/09-throw-an-error.js` \* see note below
  - [x] `src/10-an-important-file.js` \* see note below

\*Note: `promise-it-wont-hurt` has a bug which checks the full path of the files, instead of the relative paths. This causes exercise 9 & 10's verify command to fail even though the solution is correct. If the file path is the only error that you are seeing, it means that your code is correct.

### General
- [x] All dependencies are properly declared in `package.json`.
- [x] All major features are added via pull requests with a clear description and concise commit messages.
- [x] Code uses a linter and there are no linting errors.
- [x] Variables, functions, files, etc. have appropriate and meaningful names.
- [x] Functions are small and serve a single purpose.

### Stretch
- [x] Read Google's [Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises) to Promises
